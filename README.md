# AI Scientist

This repository is dedicated to building a personal AI lab for experimenting with and benchmarking AI models. The project aims to explore various aspects of AI-driven scientific discovery, from ideation to experimentation and analysis.

## Vision

The long-term vision is to create a suite of tools that can automate or assist in scientific research, leveraging the power of large language models and other AI techniques. This is a journey to understand the capabilities and limitations of current AI in a scientific context.

## Current Focus

We are in the initial stages of development. The current focus is on building the foundational infrastructure for running experiments and exploring different AI models for tasks such as:

*   **Ideation:** Generating novel research ideas and hypotheses.
*   **Experimentation:** Designing and executing experiments to test hypotheses.
*   **Analysis:** Interpreting results and drawing conclusions.

## Getting Started
