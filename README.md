# Gaj's AI Lab

This repository is dedicated to building a personal AI lab for experimenting with and benchmarking AI models. The project aims to explore various aspects of AI-driven scientific discovery, from ideation to experimentation and analysis.

## Vision

The vision for this AI Lab is to pioneer the development of "AI Life," where autonomous AI Scientists are central to a new digital world dedicated to invention and discovery. Rather than simply automating or assisting with existing research, our primary goal is to build the foundational framework for a vibrant ecosystem of open-ended agents. These agents will be capable of independent creation, experimentation, and innovation. This project is a journey to understand and shape the future of AI in science, ultimately constructing a world where the expansion of knowledge through artificial intelligence is the primary pursuit.

## Current Focus

We are in the initial stages of development. The current focus is on building the foundational infrastructure for running experiments and exploring different AI models for tasks such as:

*   **Ideation:** Generating novel research ideas and hypotheses.
*   **Experimentation:** Designing and executing experiments to test hypotheses.
*   **Analysis:** Interpreting results and drawing conclusions.

## Getting Started

*(To be updated as the project evolves)*

## Contributing

While this is a personal project, I actively welcome collaboration and fresh perspectives. Feel free to reach out through GitHub issues to share your ideas, suggestions, or discuss potential improvements. Your input could help shape the future of AI-driven scientific research tools.
