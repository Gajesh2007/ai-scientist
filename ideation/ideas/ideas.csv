Sparsity as a Mirror: A Quantitative Metric for Agent Metacognition,"We propose a novel method to evaluate an agent's intrinsic metacognition. We hypothesize that a well-developed metacognitive agent will exhibit highly stable and task-specific computational sparsity patterns. By analyzing the dynamics of these patterns with relevance scoring techniques, we can create a quantitative, behavioral metric for an agent's self-awareness.","Can the stability and specificity of emergent computational sparsity serve as a reliable, quantitative proxy for an agent's underlying metacognitive ability?","*   Develop several agents with varying levels of metacognitive ability (from none to a full implementation).

The Metacognitive Co-Pilot: Human-AI Collaborative Self-Optimization,"To mitigate the risks of fully autonomous self-modification, we propose a human-in-the-loop metacognitive system. The agent uses relevance analysis to identify potential efficiency optimizations (e.g., head pruning) and presents them, along with a generated ""impact report,"" to a human expert for approval. This balances autonomous improvement with human oversight for alignment and safety.","Can a human-in-the-loop system, where an agent proposes architectural changes and a human approves them, achieve safe and aligned self-optimization?","*   Build a UI where an agent can propose optimizations derived from SparseMM-style analysis.

"A Universal ""Concept Sparsity"" Hypothesis for LLMs","SparseMM found that ~5% of heads are ""visual."" We hypothesize this is a specific instance of a general ""concept sparsity"" principle: for any concept (math, coding, poetry), a small, identifiable subset of heads is primarily responsible.

The Recursive Narrative Generator,"To overcome the bottleneck of creating high-quality synthetic data, we propose inverting the synergy: using an R2-Reasoner-like framework to *generate* the fictional narratives. Simple tasks like describing a room will be routed to cheap models, while complex tasks like developing a plot twist will be routed to powerful models, enabling scalable, cost-effective, and coherent story generation.","Can a heterogeneous model framework be used to generate complex, coherent fictional narratives more cost-effectively than a single monolithic LLM?","*   Frame narrative generation as a decomposable task (e.g., outline, character bios, scene-by-scene generation).

The Economist Agent: Quantifying the Trade-off between Metacognitive Overhead and Performance Gain,"Current self-improvement frameworks ignore the computational cost of metacognition itself. We propose to explicitly model and measure this ""cost of thinking."" By implementing a metacognitive agent that optimizes its own sparsity, we will quantify the point at which the overhead of the reflective control loop negates the efficiency gains from architectural pruning.","What is the computational budget for metacognition, and can an agent learn to balance the cost of self-reflection against the benefits it provides?","*   Implement a dynamic sparsity agent (as in Idea 1).
*   Carefully profile the wall-clock time and FLOPs of both the base MLLM inference and the metacognitive control loop.
*   Analyze the Pareto frontier of total system latency versus task performance as a function of metacognitive frequency/complexity.","High-precision profiling tools, GPU cluster, expertise in systems engineering and performance benchmarking.",2506.05344,2506.05109,2025-06-09
Plasticity and Pruning: A Metacognitive Framework for Lifelong Architectural Self-Modification,"We propose an agent that not only prunes its architecture but also re-specializes or ""grows"" new functional units over its lifetime. Using a metacognitive loop, the agent will evaluate its performance on a stream of changing tasks, deciding when to prune dormant heads and when to re-purpose under-utilized heads for emerging skills.","Can an agent learn a lifelong policy for modifying its own neural architecture, balancing specialization (pruning) with adaptation (re-purposing)?","*   Design an agent that operates on a curriculum of diverse, sequential tasks.
*   The agent's metacognitive system tracks head utilization and performance per task.
*   The agent can take actions: (1) prune a head, (2) maintain a head, (3) mark a head for re-training on the new task.","Continual learning benchmarks, significant compute for sequential fine-tuning, expertise in neural architecture search.",2506.05344,2506.05109,2025-06-09
