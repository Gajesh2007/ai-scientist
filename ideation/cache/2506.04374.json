This trajectory is then modeled as a drift-diffusion process using a Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS) to capture distinct, latent phases of reasoning.\n\n### Key Findings\nFour distinct latent reasoning regimes were identified across multiple models and benchmarks. \u26a1 A rank-40 projection, despite its low dimensionality, explains approximately 50% of the variance in reasoning trajectories. This framework allows for low-cost simulation to anticipate critical transitions, such as reasoning failures.\n\n### Limitations & Open Questions\nThe model only captures half the trajectory variance; the significance of the remaining variance is unclear. The generalizability of the four discovered regimes requires further testing. Can this framework be extended to actively steer reasoning, not just predict it?\n\n### Transferable Techniques (\u22653 bullet points)\n*   Modeling high-dimensional time-series data (e.g., neural network activations) as a stochastic process on a low-dimensional manifold.\n*   Using Switching Linear Dynamical Systems (SLDS) to analyze processes with distinct, unobserved operational phases.\n*   Applying dimensionality reduction to make complex system analysis computationally feasible while retaining core dynamic features.\n*   Leveraging concepts from statistical physics (e.g., critical transitions) to study failure modes in complex AI systems.",

We model sentence-level hidden state\ntrajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.\nThis drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse\nreasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical\ntrajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing\nvariance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent\nreasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these\nfeatures. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools\nto study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM\nfailures.",
